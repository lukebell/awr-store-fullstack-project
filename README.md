# Full-Stack E-Commerce Take-Home Project

## 👋 Welcome!

Hello! This project is designed to test your full-stack skills by building a small, functional e-commerce API and a client-side application to consume it.

The test is composed of two sections: a **Backend (BE)** task and a **Frontend (FE)** task. Below you'll find the general guidelines and the recommended order for completing the project, followed by the specific details for each part.

## 📝 General Instructions & Guidelines

* **Deadline:** You will have **7 days** to complete the task.
* **Styling (FE):** Do not worry too much about CSS/styling. As long as we can read what is presented and the application is functional, it's fine. It doesn't need to be beautiful.
* **Testing (BE & FE):** Tests are **optional** due to time constraints. However, please think about how you'd implement them so we can discuss your approach in the next step.
* **Blockers:** If you have any questions or get stuck, please reply to the email, and we will answer you as soon as possible.

## 🗺️ Recommended Workflow

This project has two parts that depend on each other. The Backend provides the API, and the Frontend consumes it.

We recommend the following steps, but please proceed as you see fit.

1.  **Step 1: Build the Backend API.** Follow the "Part 1: Backend Task" instructions. The BE project is pre-configured to get you started quickly.
2.  **Step 2: Build the Frontend Client.** Once your BE API is running, follow the "Part 2: Frontend Task" instructions. You will build this project from scratch.
3.  **Step 3: Submit Your Work.** Please provide links to your repository (or repositories) for review.
